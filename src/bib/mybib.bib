abstract = {In the last few years, deep learning has led to very good performance on a variety of problems, such as visual recognition, speech recognition and natural language processing. Among different types of deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks have been most extensively studied. Leveraging on the rapid growth in the amount of the annotated data and the great improvements in the strengths of graphics processor units, the research on convolutional neural networks has been emerged swiftly and achieved state-of-the-art results on various tasks. In this paper, we provide a broad survey of the recent advances in convolutional neural networks. We detailize the improvements of CNN on different aspects, including layer design, activation function, loss function, regularization, optimization and fast computation. Besides, we also introduce various applications of convolutional neural networks in computer vision, speech and natural language processing.}

abstract = {Recently, a significant amount of research has been investigated on interpretation of deep neural networks (DNNs) which are normally processed as black box models. Among the methods that have been developed, local interpretation methods stand out which have the features of clear expression in interpretation and low computation complexity. Different from existing surveys which cover a broad range of methods on interpretation of DNNs, this survey focuses on local interpretation methods with an in-depth analysis of the representative works including the newly proposed approaches. From the perspective of principles, we first divide local interpretation methods into two main categories: model-driven methods and data-driven methods. Then we make a fine-grained distinction between the two types of these methods, and highlight the latest ideas and principles. We further demonstrate the effects of a number of interpretation methods by reproducing the results through open source software plugins. Finally, we point out research directions in this rapidly evolving field.}
